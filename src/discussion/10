Architecture can often frame large ceremonies, celebrations and events. Describe one such instance that you are familiar with. I think, for example, of the July 4 celebration here in Boston where the Boston Pops Orchestra plays in the “Half-shell,” an outdoor performance space covered by a “shell.” Describe such events and how the architecture was designed to accommodate and define it?
